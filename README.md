# Weather-Api-Calls
A web utility that queries a weather api based on location data

## How it works
This utility requires no setup, just open the html file, and make sure that you have 
an internet connection. The app will ask for permission to use your current location
if that's not something you want to happen, then just deny the permission and the app will
give you weather from a random large global city. Otherwise it will give weather data based on
current location.
